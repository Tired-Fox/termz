# Termz

A fast pure zig implementation of a terminal ansi library. It is heavily inspired by the `rust` crate [`crossterm`](https://docs.rs/crossterm/latest/crossterm/)

This project is still a work in progress, but already has most of the terminal ansi sequences implemented as batched commands. See `main.zig` for an example of using the commands.
